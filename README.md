# Getting Started with Coffee Vending Machine

This project was created for the purpose of Damilah tehcnical interview

## Starting the appilication

Open the included solution in VS 2022

Set both CofeeVendingMachine and StarbucksApi as 'Multiple Start Projects' in the solution properties like in the startup_settings.jpg screenshot

The git ignore does not commit the local changes, so this needs to be done manually

Of course it is possible to run them standalone but this might require additional settings of CORS

### Technical implementation

Console app for the UI

ASP. NET Core Web API

Shared library for interfacing with 3rd parties

SQlite database in the same folder

Unit test projects for both the application and api
 
### Troubleshooting

The project uses .Net Core 5 so make sure you have it installed.

Running the project should install all packages and dependencies.

Feel free to contact me for further questions.
